# MiniQuiz
Quiz for homework assignment 4 for UCSD Coding Bootcamp


## Description

This app has a quiz that has 5 multiple choice questions shown with a time limit to answer the questions. As the user answers each question text appears to let them know if they answered correctly or not. If they answer incorrectly then time is subtracted from the timer. Once the timer runs out, or all questions are answered then the user can enter their initials to save their score. Once the score is saved, then the window navigates to a high score page that shows all previously stored high scores. There the user can clear out previous high scores.
